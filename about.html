		<h2><u>Background</u></h2>
		<p>Our passion and purpose has always been and will always be JESUS. The One who takes away our sins, binds up the broken hearted, gives hope to the hopeless, heals the sick and delivers the captive. The One who is LOVE. We believe the church is the hope of the world, and want to see more of Jesus in our township, our city and the country at large. Practically, that means we are a local church with a global mission.</p>

			<h2><u>Mission</u></h2>
			<p>We believe everyone has a meaningful part to play in the Kingdom of God, called to proclaim and demonstrate the Gospel to the world. As we respond to needs, from one end of the earth to the other, we visit churches and impact communities with Godâ€™s love so we might see His Kingdom come and His will be done.

		<h3>WE WILL EMPOWER EACH PERSON IN THE CHURCH TO LIVE A KINGDOM LIFESTYLE.</h3>
		<p>We follow Jesus by encountering and obeying Him in our daily lives.</p>
		<h3>WE WILL BE PART OF TRANSFORMING NORTH-WEST, KANANA.</h3> <p>We will serve and reach out, both through specific church ministries and in our day-to-day lives.</p>

		<h3>WE WILL SEEK TO MAKE THE CHURCH A VOICE OF LOVE AND TRUTH IN KANANA.</h3>
		<p>We will continue to visit churches, win souls and raise up church partners throughout the country.</p>

		<h3>WE WILL PARTNER WITH GOD TO SEE THE CHURCH CHANGE THE WORLD.</h3>
		<p>We will continue to send short-term and long-term teams throughout the earth to reach as many people as we can with the love of God.</p>
